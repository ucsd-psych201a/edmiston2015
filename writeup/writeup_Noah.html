<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>GitHub Repository found here: https://github.com/ucsd-psych201a/edmiston2015</p>
<p>Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015) provides evidence towards notion that ambiguous labels (i.e., “dog” or “guitar”) activate knowledge of their referent quicker than environmental sounds. For example, a listener should be able to point out a dog quicker if they hear the label “dog”, rather than if they hear the sound of a dog’s bark. The reason for this, Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015) state, is due to the fact that environmental sounds activates a “particular instance of a category”. In other words, a dog’s bark may have qualities that a listener may contribute to a particular type of dog (i.e., a low pitched bark may be more indicative of a big dog, etc.). Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015) demonstrate this effect by showing that participants take longer to recognize a picture of a referent after hearing a sound associated with said referent than they do upon hearing the label.</p>
<p>In our replication, we will be revisiting experiment “1A” from the Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015) paper. We will set up an online picture-recognition task using the same materials found in the original paper. We will try and replicate the experiment exactly, manipulating the same mappings between sounds, labels, and pictures.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>Participants: We will be shooting for around 2.5x the participants that Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015) had (see Power Analysis). They only targetted undergraduates, but, since we have an online study, we can target anyone who is willing to take the study, thus testing the generalizability of Edminston &amp; Lupyan’s (2015) results.</p>
<p>Materials: We will use the same materials as Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015): labels and environmental sounds for six categories: bird, dog, drum, guitar, motorcycle, and phone. Each category will have two separate images and two separate environmental sounds. We will also implement a male and female voice for our spoken labels.</p>
<p>Procedure: We will follow the same procedure as Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015). Participants will hear a cue and see a picture, and will be prompted to decide as “quickly and accurately as possible if the picture they saw came from the same basic-level category as the word or sound they heard” (Edminston &amp; Lupyan pp.94). Following Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015), some environmental sounds will be congruent with the picture (i.e., a big dog matched with a low-pitched bark). These will be labeled as “congruent sounds”. Other environmental sounds will be deemed “incongruent sounds”, in which the picture does not necessarily match the environmental sounds (i.e., a low pitched bark matched with a picture of a small dog).</p>
<section id="power-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="power-analysis">Power Analysis</h3>
<p>Since their paper used a mixed effects linear regression model, we were not able to straightforwardly conduct a power analysis. In order to mitigate this, we just intend on collecting 2.5x the amount of participants as they did. Since they collected 43 participants, we will collect ~108 participants. This should be a large enough sample size to examine whether the effect they report holds up.</p>
</section>
<section id="planned-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="planned-sample">Planned Sample</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, we will aim for ~108 partitipants, 2.5x the amount used in hte original paper.</p>

<section id="materials" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>“The auditory cues comprised basic-level category labels and environmental sounds for six categories: bird, dog, drum, guitar, motorcycle, and phone. For each category, we obtained two distinct environmental sound cues, e.g., <classical guitar="" strum="">, <electric guitar="" strum="">, and two separate images for each subordinate category, e.g., two electric guitars for <electric guitar="" strum="">, two acoustic guitars for <electric guitar="" strum="">. To control for cue variability, we also used two versions of each spoken category label:one pronounced by a female speaker, one by a male speaker. All auditory cues were equated in duration (600 ms.) and normalized in volume. The images were color photographs (four images per category).” (pp.&nbsp;94)</electric></electric></electric></classical></p>
</section>
<section id="procedure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>“On each trial participants heard a cue and saw a picture. We instructed participants to decide as quickly and accurately as possible if the picture they saw came from the same basic-level category as the word or sound they heard Participants were tested in individual rooms sitting approximately 2400 from a monitor such that images subtended 10 10. Trials began with a 250 ms. fixation cross followed immediately by the auditory cue, delivered via headphones. The target image appeared centrally 1 s after the offset of the auditory cue and remained visible until a response was made. Each participant completed 6 practice and 384 test trials. If the picture matched the auditory cue (50% of trials) participants were instructed to respond ‘Yes’ on a gaming controller (e.g., <cellphone ring=""> or ‘‘phone’’ followed by a picture of any phone). Otherwise, they were to press ‘No’ (e.g., <cellphone ring=""> or ‘‘phone’’ followed by a dog). All factors (cue type, congruence) varied randomly within subjects. Auditory feedback (buzz or bleep) was given after each trial.” (pp.&nbsp;94)</cellphone></cellphone></p>

<p>1 factor was directly manipulated in Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015). This was the auditory cue participants heard, which could either be a label, a congruent environmental sound, or an incongruent environmental sound.</p>
<p>One measurement was taken, which was reaction time of the participants.</p>
<p>They used a within-participant design, subjecting participants to the same condition</p>
<p>The measures were repeated. 384 trials</p>
<p>There would be more confounds, and a difference in reaction time if the experimental design was switched.</p>
<p>They did not mention any direct measures to lessen the impact of demand characteristics.</p>
<p>They should have added some attention checks, given how many trials they had. I also would have kept the “incorrect” trials, given the fact that the incongruent labels may have resulted in a “no” response, which could be experimentally valid.</p>
<p>A confound could have been that they did not use a varied enough sample.</p>
<section id="data-preparation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-preparation">Data preparation</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, we will be replicating experiment 1A from Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015). As for our data preparation, we will be making sure to label the type of relationship between the sound participants hear in a given trial, and its match to the picture. In other words, we will define whether a particular trial is a label (which will just be a word such as “dog, or”guitar”), congruent sound, or incongruent sound. Furthermore, we will use the exact same audio and visual stimuli as Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015). All of the different audio files have already been clipped to make them match in duration, and they have all been amplitude normalized.</p>
<p>After we have collected our data, we will filter outliers in the exact same way as Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015). More specifically, we will filter out any reaction time (rt) that is lower that 250 ms, and any that is greater than 1500 ms. It also seems as though Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015) filtered out incorrect responses, but I am not certain about this.</p>
</section>
<section id="confirmatory-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confirmatory-analysis">Confirmatory analysis</h3>
<p>Following Edminston &amp; Lupyan (2015), we will be fitting mixed effects linear regression models to our response time data (which will be filtered for correct responses on matching trials (i.e., ‘Yes’ responses)). The model will include random intercepts, random slopes for within-subject factors, and random intercepts for repeated items. We will report the parameter estimates and confidence intervals for each “contrast of interest” (pp.94). Furthermore, we will calculate chi-square tests that will “compare nested models–models with and without the factor of interest–on improvement in log-likelihood” (pp.94).</p>

None of these need to be long.</p>
